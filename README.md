# Hidden Markov Model - AI Music Generation

## Overview

This repository builds on the hmm-music-generator project, expanding it into an educational case study on how to create a data-driven musical AI model. It mirrors the approach used by AI researchers and engineers when modeling real-world behaviors using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs).

By working through this repository, users will gain insight into the process of engineering probabilistic AI models, understanding state transitions, and refining models through experimentation and debugging.

## What This Repository Covers

### 1. Hidden Markov Models (HMMs)
- Understanding hidden states (moods) and observable states (notes)
- Designing transition probabilities to control state changes
- Assigning emission probabilities to influence note selection
- Adjusting probability distributions to see how small changes impact results

### 2. Probability & Statistics
- Ensuring that probabilities sum to 1 in distributions
- The role of self-transition probabilities in state persistence
- Balancing probabilities to prevent certain states from dominating the system
- Normalizing probability distributions from real-world data

### 3. Data Visualization
- Using Matplotlib to plot mood transitions over time
- Plotting generated melodies on a music staff
- Understanding how state transitions influence musical structure

### 4. MIDI Representation & Music Theory
- Mapping notes to MIDI values
- Understanding how moods influence note selection
- Converting probability-driven outputs into realistic musical sequences

### 5. Debugging & Model Refinement
- Fixing probability sum errors in HMM distributions
- Observing unexpected behaviors (e.g., a state dominating the transitions)
- Making incremental adjustments and testing the impact on results
- Using data-driven decisions to improve model behavior

## Key Insights from This Project

One of the major lessons from this project was observing how transition probabilities impact state persistence. Initially, the model's Melancholic state was dominant, leading to a lack of variation in mood transitions. By reducing its self-transition probability from 0.6 to 0.4 and redistributing the probability across other moods, we were able to create a more balanced and dynamic model.

This mirrors the iterative nature of AI model development, where small adjustments to parameters can significantly impact the modelâ€™s behavior.

## How to Use This Repository

### 1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/IainAmosMelchizedek/hmm-music-ai-model.git
cd hmm-music-ai-model

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional)

conda create -n hmm-ai python=3.7.6 pip
conda activate hmm-ai

### 3. Install Required Packages

pip install pomegranate numpy scipy matplotlib midiutil

### 4. Run the Model

python hmm_music_ai.py

This will generate a melody and plot mood transitions, helping users analyze how the model moves between states.
